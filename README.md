1. Install OpenCV by following the instructions on the OpenCV website.
2. Install MediaPipe by running the following command: pip install mediapipe

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command: python finger_click_simulator.py
4. A window should appear showing the live webcam feed.
5. Form a clicking gesture with your index finger and thumb.
6. The program should simulate a mouse click.
